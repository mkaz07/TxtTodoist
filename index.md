## Welcome to TxtTodoist

The main goal of TxtTodoist is to minimize the friction when adding calander events or reminders

### Why this app is useful

When we pickup our phones to do something specefic such as adding a calander event it is easy to get distracted and forget what our original intention was and just end up scrolling.
